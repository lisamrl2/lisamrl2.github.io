# Bullshit Bingo

This is an offline copy of the Bullshit Bingo game from the [Bullshit Bingo site](https://www.bullshitbingo.net/).  

Replace the words in the `words.js` file with your own ones. Keep the first and last line!

Like this:
```
const words = `

Here comes your own bullshits
Each one goes in a separate line

`;
```

Open the `index.html` in a browser. Every time you refresh the page it will generate a new Bingo card.  
Print it or play it on your laptop. Have fun! :wink:

> Play it online **[here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/domahidizoltan/bullshit-bingo/rawgit/index.html)** with the built-in content.
